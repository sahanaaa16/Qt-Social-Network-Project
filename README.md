Hello all! This is my first official GitHub submission! I plan to create more projects and utilize Github to share my coding learning with the world further.
This project was for my advanced programming class where we had to make a social network utilizing pre-uploaded databases and using several functions that suggest 
friends, create networks of friend "groups" and understand the emphasis of first, second, third, and so on connections that social networks heavily depend upon to 
make their application more personalized for a user.

This project made me understand the thin line between personalization and customization for convenience's sake and creating networks that have the potential to one 
addicted to their realm. It is a scary and unnerving fact that much of what makes social media so addictive is that it is catered to our unique tastes.
The far scarier facet is that social media companies hold the power to change our tastes and possibly manipulate our thinking or line of reasoning in any known context

I am incredibly interested in the power of social media, data science, and artificial intelligence in their abilities to drastically impact voting behaviors and 
tendencies. It combines my love for all things politics with my primary major in college and my undying yearning to understand what makes the world go round and 
if we should be engaging in these activities in the first place.

Thank you for reading and I hope you have a wonderous day :)
